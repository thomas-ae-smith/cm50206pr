void setAttributes(int speed, int scanRange, int maxLoad)

Sets the attributes for the rover.  This has to be done before the world starts.
The total attributes have to add up to 9 and speed has to be at least 1.

void move(double xOffset, double yOffset, double speed)

Moves the rover to a specified offset from its current position.  The rover travels
at the specified speed.  The power used per second is 2 * (speed / maxSpeed) where
maxSpeed is the rover's speed attribute.

void scan(double range)

Scans for resources, rovers, and bases around the rover.  The actual radius of the 
scan is 2 * range.  Each scan lasts 5 seconds and the power used per
second is 2 * (range / maxRange).

void collect()

Collects resources from the world.  Each collect only collects one resource.  Each
call takes 5 seconds and costs 1 energy per second.

void deposit()

Deposit a resource from the rover to the world.  If the rover is < .1 distance 
away from a base, it will be deposited in that base.  Otherwise, it is deposited in
the world.

double getEnergy()

Returns the current energy of the rover.

int getWorldHeight()

Returns the height of the world.

int getWorldWidth()

Returns the width of the world.

int getWorldResources()
